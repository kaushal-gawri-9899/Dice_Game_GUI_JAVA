# Dice_Game_GUI_JAVA
I implemented a multiplayer Dice Game in JAVA, created the GUI using Swing/AWT and maintained the basic MVC structure to achieve the implementation.
The source code could be found in the src folder and testing can be completed after adding the external jars provided in the jarFiles folder.
